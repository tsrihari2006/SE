Perfect 😃 that makes things way easier, Bunny. If you’ve got the sample question paper template, share it here (either type it out or upload a pic/PDF).

Once I see the exact structure (like how many sections, what type of questions — UML diagrams, theory, practical case study, test cases, etc.), I’ll:

Break it down section by section.

Give you ready-made answers/approach steps for each question type.

Point out likely variations they might throw at you.

Even prep viva questions matching that template.

That way, you’ll feel like you’ve already written the paper once before walking in tomorrow.

👉 Can you upload or paste the sample paper template here?

Nice 🔥 Bunny, I went through your sample Software Engineering Lab Internal question paper

b4367b21-a8c8-445c-88ca-1753174…

. Here’s the breakdown + how to prep efficiently for each section tonight:

📌 Paper Structure (100 Marks, 5 Hrs)

Problem Statement Analysis (10 Marks)

Maven Project Building (30 Marks)

Git & GitHub (30 Marks)

Docker (20 Marks)

Docker Compose (10 Marks)

✅ Prep Strategy for Each Question
Q1. Problem Statement Analysis – 10 Marks

They’ll give you a case (like Library Management System).
You must write:

Abstract – 4–5 lines summarizing the problem.

Functional Requirements (FRs) – Features the system must do. (E.g., login, book issue, search, generate reports).

Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) – Performance, security, scalability, availability.

Users – Actors (Admin, Student, Librarian, etc.).

👉 Practice writing 2–3 such analyses quickly so you’re fluent.

Q2. Maven Project Building – 30 Marks

Steps:

Open Eclipse → Import Maven Project

File → Import → Git → Clone URI → enter repo URL → Next → Finish.

Check Dependencies – Right click project → Maven → Update Project.

Build Project – mvn clean install → generates target/*.jar or *.war.

Verify Artifact – Check target/ folder.

👉 Revise basic Maven commands:

mvn clean – deletes target folder

mvn compile – compiles source

mvn package – builds jar/war

mvn install – installs into local repo

Q3. Git & GitHub – 30 Marks

Must know both basic flow + SQB tasks.

Initialize Repo:

git init
git config --global user.name "YourName"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"


Remote & Push:

git remote add origin <repo_url>
git push -u origin main


Common Commands:

git branch feature-x

git checkout feature-x

git merge feature-x

git revert <commit-id>

git log

👉 Revise short questions: difference between clone vs pull, reset vs revert, local vs remote branch, etc.

Q4. Docker – 20 Marks

Steps:

Write Dockerfile (for Maven/Tomcat app):

FROM tomcat:9.0
COPY target/*.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["catalina.sh", "run"]


Build Image:

docker build -t myapp:v1 .


Run Container:

docker run -d -p 8080:8080 myapp:v1


Push to DockerHub:

docker tag myapp:v1 username/myapp:v1
docker push username/myapp:v1


👉 Viva prep: image vs container, docker ps, docker exec, difference between COPY vs ADD.

Q5. Docker Compose – 10 Marks

Write a docker-compose.yml with app + DB:

version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: username/myapp:v1
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    depends_on:
      - db
  db:
    image: mysql:8
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root
      MYSQL_DATABASE: mydb


Run with:

docker-compose up


👉 Revise: difference between Dockerfile vs docker-compose, scaling services (docker-compose up --scale web=3).

🎯 What to Do Tonight

Practice one full case study (Q1).

Run through Maven build once (Q2).

Do a mini Git flow (init, commit, branch, push) (Q3).

Write & test a basic Dockerfile (Q4).

Draft a docker-compose.yml (Q5).

⚡ I can also create ready short notes + probable viva questions with answers for you to revise in 30 mins tomorrow morning.

👉 Want me to make those quick notes + viva Q&A set next?

Thought for 24s

Perfect — I’ll walk you through from Q2 → Q5 like you’ve never used any of these tools before. Step-by-step, exact commands to run, what to look for, and troubleshooting tips. I read your sample question paper template so I’ll match the flow. 

b4367b21-a8c8-445c-88ca-1753174…

I’ll assume you’re on Windows 10/11 (since your browser UA shows Windows). I’ll also give the equivalent Linux commands where useful. If anything below looks unfamiliar, don’t panic — follow the steps exactly and you’ll be fine. Let’s go.

1) Quick checklist — what you need installed (and why)

You need these tools for Q2–Q5:

Java JDK (for building Java/Maven projects)

Maven (build tool; pom.xml)

Git (version control)

Eclipse IDE (Enterprise Java Developers) or another IDE (to import project)

Docker Desktop (includes Docker Engine and Docker Compose)

(Optional) Tomcat if they expect WAR deployment locally (we’ll show Docker-based Tomcat too)

GitHub account and Docker Hub account (for pushing repo and images)

2) How to check if each tool is installed (do this first)

Open Command Prompt or PowerShell (Windows) — press Win then type powershell and open it. On Linux open a terminal.

Run these and note the outputs.

Java
java -version
javac -version


Expected: something like java version "17.0.x" (or 11).

If you see 'java' is not recognized → JDK not installed / PATH missing.

Maven
mvn -v


Expected: Apache Maven and Java version.

If mvn not found → Maven not installed or PATH not set.

Git
git --version


Expected: git version 2.x.x.

Docker
docker version
docker compose version


Expected: Docker Engine and Docker Compose versions.

If Docker Desktop not running, commands may fail.

Eclipse

No simple CLI check. Open Eclipse: Start Menu → type Eclipse and open. If it launches, it’s installed.

3) If something isn’t installed — quick install notes (Windows)

I’ll be brief — pick one method:

Java (JDK)

Install JDK 11 or 17 (Oracle/OpenJDK/Azul). After install, set JAVA_HOME to JDK folder and add %JAVA_HOME%\bin to PATH.

Test with java -version.

Maven

Download binary, unzip to C:\apache-maven\ → add C:\apache-maven\bin to PATH.

Test mvn -v.

Git

Install Git for Windows (uses Git Bash) — default installer fine. Test git --version.

Docker Desktop

Install Docker Desktop for Windows (includes Docker Compose). After install, start Docker Desktop. Test docker version.

Eclipse

Download Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java Developers and install/unzip. Launch and set workspace.

(If you want I can give exact step installers commands — tell me and I’ll detail.)

4) Now start Q2 — Maven Project Building (from zero)
Scenario A — They give you a Git repo URL

Clone repo (PowerShell):

cd C:\Users\<YourUser>\Documents
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
cd repository


You should now see pom.xml and src/ in the folder. If not, they gave a different folder — check.

Check pom.xml exists

dir
# or
ls


Look for pom.xml. This is the Maven build file.

Build with Maven (command-line)
From repository root (where pom.xml is):

mvn clean package


This downloads dependencies (first time may take a while). On success you’ll see BUILD SUCCESS.

Check the target/ folder: dir target — you'll find *.jar or *.war.

If Maven fails due to dependencies:

Ensure internet is available.

Read the error — common issue: wrong JDK version. The terminal will tell you (e.g., source level 17 required).

Import into Eclipse (GUI) — if asked to use Eclipse:

Open Eclipse → File → Import → Git → Projects from Git (with smart import) → Clone URI → paste repo URL → Next → select branch → choose local folder → Finish.

After cloning, Eclipse should detect Maven projects. If not: File → Import → Existing Maven Projects → browse to repo → Finish.

If dependencies show errors: Right-click project → Maven → Update Project... → select project → OK.

Scenario B — They give you a project folder (zip)

Unzip to a folder. Look for pom.xml. If present, follow the Build with Maven step above.

To push to GitHub (later) you’ll git init in that folder (see Q3).

How to verify generated artifact (what they will check)

Check target/ for myapp.war or myapp.jar. Example:

dir .\target\


If .war they may expect it to be deployable on Tomcat. If .jar and it’s Spring Boot, you can run:

java -jar target\yourapp.jar
# then open http://localhost:8080 (check console for exact port)

5) Q3 — Git & GitHub (step-by-step for an absolute beginner)
1) Configure Git once (replace with your details)
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"

2) Initialize (if you started from a local folder)
cd C:\path\to\project
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

3) Create a repo on GitHub (do this on github.com)

Click New repository → name it → Create repository. GitHub shows commands to push an existing repo.

4) Link remote and push
git remote add origin https://github.com/YourUser/yourrepo.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

5) Typical short tasks (SQB) — do these live so you know how:

Create branch & switch

git checkout -b feature-1


Commit changes

git add .
git commit -m "Add feature 1"


Merge into main

git checkout main
git merge feature-1


If conflict: Git marks files — open and resolve, then git add resolved files and git commit.

Revert a commit

git revert <commit-id>


Reset (dangerous)

git reset --hard <commit-id>


Clone remote repo

git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git


Common viva Qs (short answers):

git pull = fetch + merge; git fetch = only download remote changes.

git revert creates a new commit reversing changes; git reset moves branch pointer.

6) Q4 — Docker (containerize the Maven project)

They will expect: Dockerfile, build image, run container, push to Docker Hub.

A) Two common Dockerfile examples

If your project builds a runnable JAR (Spring Boot):

# Use an OpenJDK image
FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jdk-alpine
ARG JAR_FILE=target/*.jar
COPY ${JAR_FILE} app.jar
ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","/app.jar"]


If your project produces a WAR to run on Tomcat:

FROM tomcat:9.0-jdk11-openjdk
COPY target/*.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/yourapp.war
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["catalina.sh","run"]

B) Build & run the image

From project root (where Dockerfile sits):

docker build -t myapp:v1 .
docker images           # verify image exists
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name myapp-container myapp:v1
docker ps               # confirm container is running
docker logs myapp-container


Open browser: http://localhost:8080/ or http://localhost:8080/yourapp depending on project.

C) Tag & push to Docker Hub

Login (one time):

docker login
# enter Docker Hub username/password


Tag and push:

docker tag myapp:v1 yourdockerhubusername/myapp:v1
docker push yourdockerhubusername/myapp:v1

D) Useful commands (for the exam/demo)
docker ps                 # running containers
docker ps -a              # all containers
docker images             # images
docker stop myapp-container
docker rm myapp-container
docker rmi myapp:v1


Viva snapshot answers:

Image vs Container: Image = template/blueprint. Container = running instance of the image.

7) Q5 — Docker Compose (multi-container with DB)

You’ll be asked to write a docker-compose.yml that uses your pushed image and a database.

Example docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  web:
    image: yourdockerhubusername/myapp:v1
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    depends_on:
      - db
    environment:
      SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL: jdbc:mysql://db:3306/mydb
      SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME: root
      SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD: rootpw
  db:
    image: mysql:8.0
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: rootpw
      MYSQL_DATABASE: mydb
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/mysql

volumes:
  db-data:

Run & verify
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose ps
docker logs <service-name>


Both containers should be Up. If db is restarting, look at logs for missing env vars.

Shutdown & cleanup
docker-compose down --volumes

8) What examiners will practically watch for (marks come from)

Q2: Did you import/clone and successfully mvn package? Is target/ produced? (They’ll look at console logs.)

Q3: Did you initialize repo, make commits, create a branch and merge, and push to GitHub? (Show git log and GitHub repo.)

Q4: Dockerfile correct, image builds, container runs and app reachable on localhost:8080. Show docker ps & docker logs.

Q5: docker-compose brings up both web + db (show docker-compose ps). Show container inter-communication (app connecting to DB) if possible.

9) Quick exam-time checklist (print or copy to Notepad)

java -version → ok

mvn -v → ok

git --version → ok

docker version and docker compose version → ok

Clone repo: git clone <URL>

cd repo → mvn clean package (expect BUILD SUCCESS)

dir target (see .jar/.war)

Create Dockerfile (see above) → docker build -t myapp:v1 .

docker run -d -p 8080:8080 myapp:v1 → open browser → verify

docker tag + docker push → push to Docker Hub

Create docker-compose.yml → docker-compose up -d → docker-compose ps

If you do these in order, you’ll cover every practical step they’ll ask for.

10) Mini time-management plan for a 5-hour internal

0.5 hr — check environment & clone project

1 hr — build project with Maven; fix immediate issues

0.5 hr — import into Eclipse and show project structure

1 hr — Dockerize (write Dockerfile) and test locally

0.5 hr — push image to Docker Hub & push code to GitHub

0.5 hr — write docker-compose and test DB integration

1 hr — buffer: fix small errors, answer viva, document steps in log

11) Final tips, common errors & fixes

Maven dependency download stuck: check proxy/internet; try mvn -U clean package.

Port 8080 in use: change host port mapping -p 9090:8080.

Docker build fails: read error — often wrong COPY path or build context (must run docker build from project root).

Git push denied: you need to create remote repo and set correct URL; check credentials.

If you want, I’ll now:

Generate a one-page cheat sheet you can print (commands + Dockerfile + docker-compose) OR

Make a step-by-step script (copy-pasteable commands) for you to run locally right now to verify your laptop.

Which of those two do you want me to produce immediately? (I’ll make it exactly copy/paste ready.)

        # demoapp - Sample Maven Spring Boot project for lab practice

        This is a tiny Spring Boot app with one endpoint `/hello` that returns a greeting.
        Use this project to practice the lab tasks: Maven build, Git workflow, Dockerize, push image, docker-compose.

        ## Files of interest
        - `pom.xml` : Maven build file
        - `src/main/java/...` : Java source with a HelloController
        - `Dockerfile` : Dockerfile to build runnable image for the jar
        - `docker-compose.yml` : Example compose file with MySQL
        - `README.md` : this file

        ## Practice Tasks (what you'll do)
        Q2. Maven:
          1. Build the project with: `mvn clean package`
          2. Inspect `target/` for the generated jar (ex: `demoapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`)

        Q3. Git/GitHub:
          1. Initialize git (if starting from zip): `git init`
          2. Commit code: `git add . && git commit -m "initial commit"`
          3. Create a repo on GitHub and follow instructions to add remote and push.

        Q4. Docker:
          1. Build image: `docker build -t demoapp:v1 .`
          2. Run container: `docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name demoapp demoapp:v1`
          3. Visit http://localhost:8080/hello

        Q5. Docker Compose:
          1. `docker-compose up --build`
          2. Verify both `web` and `db` services are UP.

        ## Notes
        - This project uses Spring Boot; your machine needs internet to download Maven dependencies the first time.
        - If `mvn package` fails, read errors carefully — it usually hints the problem (JDK mismatch, proxy, or missing internet).

Awesome — I created a small practice Maven project for you (includes pom.xml, a tiny Spring Boot app, Dockerfile, and docker-compose.yml) so you can do the full Q2→Q5 flow locally, step-by-step.

👉 Download the repo ZIP here: Download demoapp.zip

I'll give you 4 practice questions (one per lab section) using this repo, then walk you through each task step-by-step — exact commands to copy/paste, what to expect, and how to fix common errors.

Practice Questions (use the repo you downloaded)

Q2 (Maven) — 30 marks (practice)
Repository: the downloaded demoapp
Task: Build the project with Maven and show the generated artifact.
Deliverable: Console output showing BUILD SUCCESS and target/*.jar.

Q3 (Git & GitHub) — 30 marks (practice)
Task: Initialize a git repo (if you used the zip), make commits, create a branch feature/add-endpoint, add a new endpoint /time returning current server time, merge into main, and push to GitHub (you will create a GitHub repo and add it as origin).
Deliverable: Git log showing branch and merge; a GitHub repo link.

Q4 (Docker) — 20 marks (practice)
Task: Create a Docker image using the included Dockerfile, run the container, and show http://localhost:8080/hello working. Tag and push the image to Docker Hub.
Deliverable: docker ps output showing container running and image on Docker Hub.

Q5 (Docker Compose) — 10 marks (practice)
Task: Use the included docker-compose.yml to bring up the web and db services and verify both are Up.
Deliverable: docker-compose ps output showing web and db healthy.

Step-by-step walkthrough — do these in order

I'll give commands (PowerShell/Windows and Linux) and explain each command and expected output.

A. Prepare workspace

Unzip the file and open a terminal in the project folder.

Windows (PowerShell):

# unzip using File Explorer or:
Expand-Archive -Path C:\Users\<you>\Downloads\demoapp.zip -DestinationPath C:\Users\<you>\Documents\demoapp
cd C:\Users\<you>\Documents\demoapp


Linux:

unzip ~/Downloads/demoapp.zip -d ~/projects/demoapp
cd ~/projects/demoapp


You should now see pom.xml, src/, Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, README.md.

Q2 — Maven build (exact commands + explanation)

Command

mvn -v
mvn clean package


What each does

mvn -v — checks Maven and Java versions (sanity check). Expect output like:

Apache Maven 3.8.x
Java version: 17.0.x, vendor...


mvn clean package — cleans previous builds and packages the app into an executable jar (target/demoapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar). First run downloads dependencies — may take a few minutes.

Expected outputs

Dependency download logs (INFO lines).

At the end: BUILD SUCCESS

Check artifact:

ls target
# expect: demoapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar and some other files


Common errors & fixes

Error: java: invalid source release: 17 → You're using older JDK. Install JDK 17 or change <java.version> in pom.xml to installed JDK (but exam environment likely expects 11/17).

Error: network/proxy errors → ensure internet connection; if behind college proxy you may need to set proxy in ~/.m2/settings.xml.

Q3 — Git & GitHub (step-by-step with explanations)
1) Initialize repo (only if you started from zip)
git init
git status


git init creates a .git directory. git status shows untracked files.

2) First commit
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - demoapp"


git add . stages all files.

git commit creates the commit.

3) Create branch and add /time endpoint

Create a new Java file TimeController.java (I'll show the content you should add):

File: src/main/java/com/example/demoapp/TimeController.java

package com.example.demoapp;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
import java.time.LocalDateTime;

@RestController
public class TimeController {
    @GetMapping("/time")
    public String time() {
        return "Server time: " + LocalDateTime.now().toString();
    }
}


Commands:

git checkout -b feature/add-endpoint
git add src/main/java/com/example/demoapp/TimeController.java
git commit -m "Add /time endpoint"


Explain

git checkout -b feature/add-endpoint creates and switches to a new branch.

Committing isolates changes to that branch.

4) Merge into main
git checkout main
git merge feature/add-endpoint


If a conflict appears (unlikely here), Git will show conflicting files; fix them, then git add + git commit.

5) Create remote repo on GitHub and push

Do this in your browser:

Go to github.com → New repository → name it demoapp-lab-practice (public or private).

GitHub will show commands to add remote. Run the shown commands, for HTTPS:

git remote add origin https://github.com/<yourusername>/demoapp-lab-practice.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main


After push, go to the GitHub repo page and confirm files are there and /time code is present in commit history.

Common push errors

failed to push some refs → you may need to git pull --rebase origin main if remote has initial commit. If remote empty, should be fine.

Authentication: use PAT (personal access token) for HTTPS or set up SSH keys.

Q4 — Dockerize & run (step-by-step)

We included a Dockerfile for a runnable jar. Build the image:

Build image

docker build -t demoapp:v1 .


docker build reads Dockerfile, builds image and tags it demoapp:v1.

Check image exists

docker images
# look for 'demoapp' with tag 'v1'


Run container

docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name demoapp demoapp:v1


-d runs detached, -p host:container maps port so your host can reach the app at http://localhost:8080/hello

--name demoapp names the container.

Verify

docker ps — shows running container

docker logs demoapp — view startup logs, should show Spring Boot started and port 8080

In browser visit: http://localhost:8080/hello → should show Hello from demoapp!

Also test /time: http://localhost:8080/time

Push to Docker Hub
Login:

docker login
# enter username/password (or PAT)


Tag & push:

docker tag demoapp:v1 <yourdockerhubusername>/demoapp:v1
docker push <yourdockerhubusername>/demoapp:v1


Explain

Tagging prepares image name for Docker Hub (username/repo:tag).

Push uploads the image to Docker Hub.

Common errors

permission denied on docker command → ensure Docker Desktop is running or your user is in docker group (Linux).

Port conflicts: if 8080 used, use -p 9090:8080 and visit http://localhost:9090/hello.

Q5 — Docker Compose (step-by-step)

We provided a docker-compose.yml.

Bring up services

docker-compose up --build


--build rebuilds images before running.

Verify

docker-compose ps


Both web and db should show status Up (maybe healthy for db after a short time).

Test

Visit http://localhost:8080/hello (served by the web service).

Check DB logs:

docker-compose logs db


Shutdown and cleanup

docker-compose down --volumes --rmi local


--volumes removes DB volume, --rmi local removes local images built by compose.

After you try: tell me what happened

Do these tasks now. When you're done with each step, copy/paste the terminal output (or summarize any errors). I will:

Inspect the output.

Explain what went wrong (if anything) and how to fix it.

Help you prepare the short viva answers for each section based on what you did.

Extra: Quick cheat sheet (copy/paste)
# Build
mvn clean package

# Git

ChatGPT said:

🔥 Perfect, Bunny — this means your Maven project built successfully. That’s exactly what the examiner wants to see for Q2 ✅.

Let’s unpack what just happened:

Maven downloaded dependencies (guava, commons-lang3, etc.).

It repackaged the JAR (Spring Boot does this automatically so you get a self-contained executable JAR).

At the end you see BUILD SUCCESS 🎉.

✅ What you should do now (to finish Q2 properly in exam):

Check the artifact in target/
Run:

ls target


or (Windows PowerShell):

dir target


You should see something like:

demoapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar


That file is your deliverable.

(Optional) Run the app directly (shows off in viva 😎):

java -jar target/demoapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar


Expected: Spring Boot starts → “Started DemoappApplication in X seconds” → app running on port 8080.
Test in browser: http://localhost:8080/hello
.

👉 Next up is Q3: Git & GitHub. Here’s what we’ll do:

Initialize a Git repo (since you got the project from zip).

Make your first commit.

Create a branch (feature/add-endpoint) → add /time endpoint → commit.

Merge into main.

Create GitHub repo and push.

Do you want me to give you the exact commands and code for /time endpoint so you can continue smoothly into Q3 right now?

ChatGPT said:

Perfect 👏👏 — you’ve nailed Q2 (Maven Project Build).

What this means:

demoapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar (17 MB) → this is your final runnable JAR.

demoapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar.original → the pre-repackaged JAR (Spring Boot keeps a copy).

👉 In the exam, if you just show the examiner:

dir target


with that .jar visible + mention that BUILD SUCCESS appeared, you’ll bag the full marks for Q2 ✅.
(Extra brownie points if you actually run it: java -jar target/demoapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar and show the /hello endpoint in browser.)

⚡ Now let’s jump to Q3 – Git & GitHub (30 marks).
Here’s the step-by-step plan for you:

🔹 Step 1 — Initialize Git Repo

From your project root (C:\Users\bhaga\Desktop\use me!\SE\):

git init
git config --global user.name "Bhaga"
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - demoapp"

🔹 Step 2 — Create a Feature Branch
git checkout -b feature/add-endpoint

🔹 Step 3 — Add a New Endpoint (/time)

Create a new file:
src/main/java/com/example/demoapp/TimeController.java

Paste this code:

package com.example.demoapp;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
import java.time.LocalDateTime;

@RestController
public class TimeController {

    @GetMapping("/time")
    public String getTime() {
        return "Server time: " + LocalDateTime.now().toString();
    }
}


Now stage and commit:

git add src/main/java/com/example/demoapp/TimeController.java
git commit -m "Add /time endpoint"

🔹 Step 4 — Merge Feature Branch into Main
git checkout main
git merge feature/add-endpoint

🔹 Step 5 — Push to GitHub

Go to GitHub
 → New repository → name it demoapp-lab-practice.

Copy the HTTPS URL of the repo.

Link & push:

git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/demoapp-lab-practice.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main


✅ Deliverable for exam: Show your GitHub repo in browser with commits + branches.

Do you want me to also give you a set of common viva Qs & answers they can ask in Q3 (like difference between merge & rebase, or reset & revert) so you’re bulletproof in viva?

You said:

fatal: pathspec 'src/main/java/com/example/demoapp/TimeController.java' did not match any files
ChatGPT said:

Ahh, got it 👍 — that error means the file doesn’t exist yet.
Git is telling you: “I can’t add this file because you haven’t created it.”

👉 Let’s fix this step-by-step:

✅ Step 1 — Create the file

Navigate to:

C:\Users\bhaga\Desktop\use me!\SE\src\main\java\com\example\demoapp\


Inside that folder, create a new file called:

TimeController.java


Paste this code into it:

package com.example.demoapp;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
import java.time.LocalDateTime;

@RestController
public class TimeController {

    @GetMapping("/time")
    public String getTime() {
        return "Server time: " + LocalDateTime.now().toString();
    }
}


Save the file ✅

✅ Step 2 — Tell Git about the new file

Now run in terminal:

git add src/main/java/com/example/demoapp/TimeController.java
git commit -m "Add /time endpoint"

✅ Step 3 — Verify commit

Check with:

git log --oneline --graph --all


You should see your new commit (Add /time endpoint) on branch feature/add-endpoint.

👉 Once that’s done, we’ll merge this branch into main.
Do you want me to walk you through the merge step right now, or should I wait until you confirm the commit worked?

fatal: pathspec 'src/main/java/com/example/demoapp/TimeController.java' did not match any files
ChatGPT said:

Ahh I see what happened 🤔 — the path you’re giving Git has an extra src/main/java/com/example/demoapp prefix repeated.

Right now, your terminal prompt shows:

C:\Users\bhaga\Desktop\use me!\SE\src\main\java\com\example\demoapp>


That means you are already inside the com/example/demoapp folder.
So when you type:

git add src/main/java/com/example/demoapp/TimeController.java


Git interprets it as:

<current folder>/src/main/java/com/example/demoapp/TimeController.java


…which doesn’t exist, hence the error.

✅ Fix

Since you’re already inside the folder that contains the file, just run:

git add TimeController.java
git commit -m "Add /time endpoint"

🔎 Double-check

To make sure Git sees the file staged:

git status


You should see something like:

Changes to be committed:
  new file:   src/main/java/com/example/demoapp/TimeController.java


Once the commit is successful, we’ll move to:

git checkout main
git merge feature/add-endpoint


👉 Want me to guide you through that merge step next?

You said:
git status
ChatGPT said:

Perfect move 👍 — git status will tell us if your new file (TimeController.java) is staged or already committed.

Here’s what you might see:

✅ Case 1: If you already ran git add TimeController.java

git status should show something like:

On branch feature/add-endpoint
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   src/main/java/com/example/demoapp/TimeController.java


👉 That means the file is staged — now you just need:

git commit -m "Add /time endpoint"

✅ Case 2: If you already committed it

Then git status will show:

On branch feature/add-endpoint
nothing to commit, working tree clean


👉 That means your commit was successful 🎉

⚡ Next step after confirming:

git checkout main
git merge feature/add-endpoint


This will merge your new /time endpoint into main.

👉 Can you paste me exactly what git status showed on your screen so I can confirm which case you’re in?

You said:
On branch feature/add-endpoint
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   ../../../../../../target/classes/com/example/demoapp/DemoappApplication.class
        modified:   ../../../../../../target/classes/com/example/demoapp/HelloController.class

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        ../../../../../../target/classes/com/example/demoapp/TimeController.class
ChatGPT said:

Nice — thanks for sharing that output 👀.
Here’s what it means:

You’re currently on branch feature/add-endpoint ✅

Git is tracking changes inside target/classes (compiled .class files).

But the actual TimeController.java source file isn’t listed — only the compiled .class in target/classes is showing as untracked.

That’s why you’re not seeing the .java file in the status.

✅ Why this happened

You created TimeController.java in the right place, but your git status output came while you were inside the src/main/java/com/example/demoapp/ directory.
Git shows paths relative to where you run the command, which is why it displayed those ../../../../ long paths.

Also, your .gitignore probably doesn’t exclude target/, so Git is trying to track compiled class files (which we don’t want).

✅ Fix step by step

Go back to the project root:

cd C:\Users\bhaga\Desktop\use me!\SE


Now explicitly add the .java file:

git add src/main/java/com/example/demoapp/TimeController.java


Commit:

git commit -m "Add /time endpoint"


(Optional but recommended) Ignore target/ so Git stops tracking compiled files:
Create a file called .gitignore in your project root with this content:

target/


Then:

git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Ignore target directory"


👉 After that, run:

git log --oneline --graph --all


You should see your new commit "Add /time endpoint" on feature/add-endpoint.

Do you want me to also give you the expected output of /time if you run the app again with java -jar target/demoapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar — so you can confirm your controller works before merging?

You said:
C:\Users\bhaga\Desktop\use me!\SE>git log --oneline --graph --all
* 14d4912 (HEAD -> feature/add-endpoint) Add /time endpoint
* 4a136a1 (master) Initial commit - demoapp
ChatGPT said:

Perfect 👌 — now you’ve officially got two commits:

4a136a1 → your Initial commit - demoapp on master (a.k.a main).

14d4912 → your Add /time endpoint on branch feature/add-endpoint.

That’s exactly the workflow they’ll expect you to demo in Q3 ✅.

🚀 Next step: Merge your feature branch into main

Switch back to main:

git checkout main


Merge your feature:

git merge feature/add-endpoint


👉 Expected output:

Updating 4a136a1..14d4912

Check the commit history now:

git log --oneline --graph --all


You should see both commits on main.

🏁 After this:

Your main branch now contains the /time endpoint.

You’re ready for the push to GitHub step.

👉 Do you want me to guide you through creating the GitHub repo + push commands next, or do you want to first test the /time endpoint locally by running the JAR?

You said:
C:\Users\bhaga\Desktop\use me!\SE>git checkout main
error: pathspec 'main' did not match any file(s) known to git
ChatGPT said:

Ahhh, I see what’s going on 🚨 — your repo is using master as the default branch, not main.

That’s why git checkout main failed — there is no branch named main yet.

✅ Fix

Use this instead:

git checkout master
git merge feature/add-endpoint


👉 This will merge your feature branch into master.
After the merge, git log --oneline --graph --all should show both commits on master.

⚡ Then when you push to GitHub, you can either:

Keep the branch name master, or

Rename it to main to match GitHub’s default:

git branch -M main


Do you want me to show you the safe way to push this to a new GitHub repo (step-by-step) right after the merge?

ChatGPT said:

Beautiful 🙌 — that merge worked exactly as expected!

You just pulled your /time feature into the main branch. And now by running:

git branch -M main


you’ve renamed master → main, which is perfect because GitHub defaults to main.

✅ Next: Push to GitHub

Create a new repo on GitHub

Go to GitHub → New repository
.

Name it something like demoapp-lab-practice.

Leave it empty (⚠ don’t add README, .gitignore, or license).

Link your local repo to GitHub
Copy the HTTPS URL from GitHub (looks like https://github.com/<your-username>/demoapp-lab-practice.git).
Then run:

git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/demoapp-lab-practice.git
git push -u origin main


👉 The first push may ask for your GitHub username/password or a Personal Access Token (PAT). If you haven’t set that up, I’ll guide you.

Verify on GitHub

Go to your repo page in browser.

You should see all your project files, commits, and branches.

✅ That completes Q3 (Git & GitHub) — you’ve:

Initialized a repo

Made commits

Created a branch

Merged into main

Pushed to GitHub

Full marks 🏆

👉 Want me to walk you straight into Q4 (Dockerize and run your app) now?

3.	Solve the given SQB (Short Question Based) Git tasks (e.g., branch, merge, revert) Push your Maven project to GitHub 
ChatGPT said:

Exactly 💯 Bunny — Q3 is two parts:

Do a few Short Question Based (SQB) Git tasks (branch, merge, revert, etc.)

Push your Maven project to GitHub

You already did most of this 😎 — you created a branch (feature/add-endpoint) → committed → merged into main. That’s branch + merge done.

Now let’s quickly knock out 1–2 extra SQB tasks (revert, log, reset) so you can confidently answer in the exam.

🔹 SQB Git Tasks You Can Show in Exam
1. Branch creation & merge (✅ you already did this)
git checkout -b feature/add-endpoint
git commit -m "Add /time endpoint"
git checkout main
git merge feature/add-endpoint

2. Revert a commit

Suppose you want to undo your last commit (without deleting history).

git log --oneline
# note the commit ID of "Add /time endpoint" (example: 14d4912)

git revert 14d4912


👉 This creates a new commit that undoes the changes of that commit.
Examiners love this one — shows you know history-safe undo.

3. Reset (difference from revert)
git reset --hard HEAD~1


👉 Moves your branch pointer back by 1 commit (deletes commit history).
⚠ Dangerous in real life, but good to explain in viva.

4. Git log & graph (to show commit history clearly)
git log --oneline --graph --all


👉 Examiner sees clean history with branches and merges.

🔹 Push to GitHub (final step of Q3)

You’re ready for this now:

git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/demoapp-lab-practice.git
git push -u origin main

📝 Probable Viva Questions (with answers)

Q: Difference between git reset and git revert?

reset removes commits (history rewrite).

revert creates a new commit that undoes previous commit (safe for shared repos).

Q: What’s the difference between git fetch and git pull?

fetch downloads changes but doesn’t merge.

pull = fetch + merge.

Q: What’s the difference between local and remote branch?

Local exists on your machine.

Remote branch exists on GitHub/remote server.

Q: How do you resolve a merge conflict?

Open the file, edit to keep the correct code, then git add and git commit.

👉 You’ve already covered branch + merge.
Do you want me to give you an exact mini-demo sequence (commands you can run right now) for revert + reset using your repo, so you practice and see what happens?

You said:
4.	Verify the generated artifact in the target/ folder 
what about this in qns 2
ChatGPT said:

Good catch 🚀 — that line in Q2 is important because it’s exactly what the examiner will look for to confirm you did the Maven build correctly.

✅ What “Verify the generated artifact in the target/ folder” means:

After you run:

mvn clean package


Maven places the compiled output inside the target/ folder.
In your case, you already saw this:

demoapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar   (17 MB) ✅
demoapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar.original


So the artifact is:
👉 demoapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

✅ How to show verification in the exam

Run:

dir target


(or ls target on Linux/Mac)

Expected output:

11-09-2025  22:02        17,691,525 demoapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
11-09-2025  22:02             3,135 demoapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar.original


Then say:

“This .jar file is the artifact generated by Maven. I can now run it directly with java -jar target/demoapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar or deploy it with Docker/Tomcat.”

✅ Bonus (show off in viva 😎)

Run the jar:

java -jar target/demoapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar


Expected console logs:

Tomcat started on port(s): 8080 (http) ...
Started DemoappApplication in X seconds


Now open http://localhost:8080/hello

→ You’ll see: Hello from demoapp!
(and also test http://localhost:8080/time
 once you added that endpoint).

So for Q2 full marks you need to:

Clone/import project ✅

Build with Maven ✅

Show BUILD SUCCESS ✅

Show artifact in target/ ✅ (you did)

(Optional but great) Run artifact to prove it works 💯

👉 Do you want me to prepare a ready 4-step demo script you can just run in sequence during exam for Q2 (clone → build → show target → run jar)?

Name it demoapp-lab-practice

Keep it empty (⚠ don’t add README, .gitignore, or license).

Link local repo to GitHub remote

https://github.com/<your-username>/demoapp-lab-practice.git


Then run:

git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/demoapp-lab-practice.git
git push -u origin main


Verify

Open your GitHub repo page.

You should see your files + both commits (Initial commit, Add /time endpoint).

🎯 That will finish Q3 (Git & GitHub) fully: branch ✅, merge ✅, revert/reset (you can explain in viva), push ✅.

👉 Want me to move you straight into Q4 (Docker) next — writing the Dockerfile, building the image, and running the container — so you’ll be ready to show it in the lab?

Alright Bunny 🚀 — let’s dive into Q4: Docker (20 Marks).
This is where you’ll containerize your Maven project. Since you’ve already got the .jar in target/, you’re ready to Dockerize.

🔹 Step 1 — Write a Dockerfile

In your project root (C:\Users\bhaga\Desktop\use me!\SE), create a file named:

Dockerfile


Paste this inside:

# Base image with JDK 17
FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jdk-alpine

# Copy the built jar into the container
ARG JAR_FILE=target/*.jar
COPY ${JAR_FILE} /app.jar

# Command to run the app
ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","/app.jar"]


✅ This tells Docker:

Use a lightweight Java 17 image.

Copy your Maven-built JAR into the container.

Run it with java -jar.

🔹 Step 2 — Build the Docker Image

Run in terminal (from project root):

docker build -t demoapp:v1 .


-t demoapp:v1 tags your image as demoapp with version v1.

. means Docker will look for Dockerfile in current directory.

Check if it built:

docker images


👉 You should see demoapp v1 listed.

🔹 Step 3 — Run the Container
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name demoapp demoapp:v1


-d → detached (background).

-p 8080:8080 → maps container’s port 8080 → host’s port 8080.

--name demoapp → container name.

Check running container:

docker ps


👉 You should see demoapp up and running.

🔹 Step 4 — Test in Browser

Open:

http://localhost:8080/hello
 → should show Hello from demoapp!

http://localhost:8080/time
 → should show Server time: ...

Check logs (if needed):

docker logs demoapp


👉 You’ll see Spring Boot startup logs.

🔹 Step 5 — Push to Docker Hub

Login:

docker login


Tag the image:

docker tag demoapp:v1 <your-dockerhub-username>/demoapp:v1


Push:

docker push <your-dockerhub-username>/demoapp:v1


✅ Now your image is on Docker Hub, and you can pull it anywhere.

🎯 What examiner expects in Q4:

Show your Dockerfile.

Run docker build (prove image built).

Run docker run + docker ps (prove container running).

Optional: Open browser → show app working.

Push to Docker Hub (show repo on Docker Hub).

👉 Want me to also prepare a ready-made docker-compose.yml for Q5 so you can directly run both your app + MySQL in one go?

You said:
C:\Users\bhaga\Desktop\use me!\SE>docker build -t demoapp:v1 .
ERROR: error during connect: Head "http://%2F%2F.%2Fpipe%2FdockerDesktopLinuxEngine/_ping": open //./pipe/dockerDesktopLinuxEngine: The system cannot find the file specified.
ChatGPT said:

Ah, Bunny — that error is a classic Windows + Docker Desktop issue 🚨.
It’s basically saying: “I can’t talk to the Docker engine because it’s not running.”

✅ Why this happens

Docker Desktop isn’t started yet.

Or Docker Desktop isn’t installed properly.

Or WSL2 / Hyper-V isn’t enabled on your machine.

✅ Fix Step by Step

Check if Docker Desktop is installed

Press Win key → type Docker Desktop.

If you see it, open it.

Wait until the little whale icon appears in the taskbar, and it says “Docker is running”.

Start Docker Desktop manually

Open Docker Desktop.

It may take 1–2 minutes to boot.

Then run again in terminal:

docker version


👉 If working, you’ll see Client and Server info. If it still errors, Docker engine isn’t starting.

If Docker Desktop is not installed

Download & install from: Docker Desktop for Windows
.

During install, tick “Use WSL2” (if prompted).

Enable WSL2 / Hyper-V (if installer asks)

Open PowerShell as Admin:

dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart


Reboot PC.

✅ What to try now

Open Docker Desktop.

Wait until it says “Docker Engine is running”.

In terminal, test:

docker version
docker ps


👉 If both work without error, retry your build:

docker build -t demoapp:v1 .


⚡ Exam tip: They might not give you time to fix Docker Desktop issues during the test. So always start Docker Desktop as soon as you log in, and confirm docker version works before the exam begins.

👉 Do you want me to also give you a backup plan (like running the JAR directly instead of Docker) in case Docker fails during exam?

Yesss 🔥 — now Docker is running perfectly on your system 🎉

That docker version output shows both Client and Server, which means the Docker Engine is alive and ready.

✅ Next step: Build your image (Q4)

From your project root (C:\Users\bhaga\Desktop\use me!\SE):

docker build -t demoapp:v1 .


👉 Expected:

Step logs (downloading base image, copying jar, etc.).

Ends with something like:

Successfully built <image-id>
Successfully tagged demoapp:v1

✅ Step 2: Verify image
docker images


You should see:

REPOSITORY   TAG   IMAGE ID     SIZE
demoapp      v1    abc123def    xxxMB

✅ Step 3: Run container
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name demoapp demoapp:v1


Check:

docker ps


👉 Should show demoapp running and exposing port 8080.

✅ Step 4: Test your app

Open browser:

http://localhost:8080/hello
 → Hello from demoapp!

http://localhost:8080/time
 → Server time: ...
